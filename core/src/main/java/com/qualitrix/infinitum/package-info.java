/**
 * <p>
 * <b>Infinitum</b> is a set of Java libraries for fast-tracking delivery of
 * test automation projects. It is made available as small, pre-compiled Maven
 * modules. Individual modules can be picked up based on what is relevant to a
 * testing team, depending on the needs of the project under consideration. In
 * addition to this, modularity of libraries keeps the overall size of an
 * automation project in check, while at the same time allowing testing teams
 * to add modules as and when required.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Infinitum leverages common, widely-used frameworks and libraries used for
 * automating functional and integration testing. Some frameworks and libraries
 * used by Infinitum include Maven for building and running automation
 * projects, TestNG for orchestrating tests and Selenium for running tests.
